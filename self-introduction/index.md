Hi.

My name is Andrey, and it's sad to talk about it, but now I don't have a technical education and a job, but I have something else,
I have a lot of free time and a desire to fix it.

In February, I quit my job as a streamer, and it was decided to completely change the type of activity.

After listening to the bloggers and information noise from the sites like Yandex Practicum, I decided to try to study programming, and as I realized that I had a chance to become a Developer, I fully devoted myself to this goal.

For study I chose Python and regretted it several times. In the process of learning, I learned more and more about the IT world and as soon as I learned more about the Front-end, it was decided to change the direction of study.

Then I finished the second Python book, I start learning the Front-end.
I didn't like the way I was studying on my own, I was very lazy, but I studied everyday.
That's why I started looking for programming courses and accidentally found RS school.

Why exactly was Front-end chosen?

I've always liked creating designs for my stream, and as soon as I realized that Front-end was doing this, I already knew what technologies I wanted to study.
Studying at the RSchool, I became convinced that this is exactly what I will be interested in for many years to come.

A few words about my educational project.

The last task we had on the course was SongBird. This task is needed to improve our understanding of async programming, WebPack, clean code, and I completely failed at these points.
I couldn't apply Async\await, violated all the rules of clean code and as a result could not properly assemble it with a webpack. It was a complete fail.
I could not fulfill the recommendations for the task, but I completed the task.

In conclusion, I want to say:
I'm not the best student, but I don't get upset...
Just need a little more time and I can handle everything.

Thank you if you have listened to the end.

Bye.
